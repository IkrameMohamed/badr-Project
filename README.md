## Project Description

We aim to develop a web application for the national association El-Badr to assist cancer patients.

Our application includes a homepage that defines the association and its history, as well as the events they will organize and all the details on the subject so that people can attend. All visitors can consult the services provided by the association, its different spaces, objectives, activities, and also send comments. Patients can request to create an account by entering their personal information and medical records. The admin will process the request, verify the medical records, and send the response by email.

Patients who already have an account can send messages, schedule appointments with doctors, such as being informed about available days and hours, and patients can choose the time and day that suits them. There is also a page to help patients, where it contains a set of things that the association can provide such as medication, wheelchairs, a blood pressure monitor, blood glucose monitoring, etc. They can also request a residence for chemotherapy or radiotherapy.
